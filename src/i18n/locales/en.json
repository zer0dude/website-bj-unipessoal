      "title": "Multi-Agent Technical Ticket Assistant",
      "description": "Advanced AI application demonstrating pragmatic automation of technical support workflows through sophisticated multi-agent architecture",
      "executiveSummary": "This comprehensive demonstration showcases how modern AI application principles can transform technical support operations for German SMEs. Using Pumpen GmbH, a fictional water pump manufacturer, as our case study, this project illustrates the practical implementation of multi-agent systems, context engineering, and human-in-the-loop design patterns to dramatically reduce human workload while maintaining service excellence. A fully interactive live demonstration is available, allowing direct interaction with the multi-agent system.",
      "businessContext": "Technical support represents a significant operational burden for manufacturing companies like Pumpen GmbH. Valuable engineering resources are diverted from core product development to handle routine customer inquiries about pump specifications, troubleshooting procedures, and maintenance protocols. This demo addresses a critical business challenge: how can advanced AI applications preserve technical expertise while automating repetitive support workflows?",
      "agentArchitecture": "A best practice AI agent architecture should provide the AI with essential tools: context, akin to a small whiteboard for the AI to keep notes and relevant information. External resources for accessing relevant information with different types of access such as read or even write. Furthermore, AI agents benefit from having the ability of creating artifacts of their work - pieces of work that are worth having more static and long-term form than the ephemeral context and pieces of work that are relevant to the parties working with the AI. Such an architecture places an AI agent in the world with clear scope and boundary, making it easy for the AI agent to work effectively and for other parties to interact with it predictably.",
      "technicalApproach": "AI agent development, just as any other form of complex development, benefits immensely from lean agile development and prototyping to quickly and cheaply understand the context of the task and its difficult-to-foresee challenges. This demonstration was built using Streamlit, a library enabling rapid development of simple prototypes without focusing on UI complexity. The implementation is model-agnostic, highly modular, and deliberately avoids agentic orchestration tools such as LangChain or n8n. By taking this approach in early prototyping stages, one gains better understanding of task context and requirements for more complex, powerful tools. This strategy allows adaptation to sophisticated frameworks only once their value is proven worthwhile, avoiding premature technological lock-in.",
      "keyOutcomes": "This demonstration proves that sophisticated AI applications can deliver measurable business value without compromising service quality. The system showcases practical approaches to context preservation, agent coordination, and human-in-the-loop validation that are directly applicable to real-world enterprise implementations. The project establishes a framework for value-driven AI application design that prioritizes business outcomes over technological complexity.",
      "businessValue": "For German SMEs facing similar technical support challenges, this demonstration provides a roadmap for implementing advanced AI solutions that respect both technical requirements and business constraints. The approach emphasizes practical value generation, sustainable implementation practices, and maintainable system architecture that can evolve with changing business needs.",
      "demoTitle": "Live Demonstration",
      "demoDescription": "Experience the multi-agent system in action through an interactive Streamlit application. The demo allows you to submit technical tickets and observe the coordinated response of multiple AI agents as they research, analyze, and formulate solutions using the RPE framework.",
      "githubTitle": "Source Code",
      "githubDescription": "Explore the complete source code implementation, including multi-agent architecture patterns, context engineering techniques, and integration strategies. ",
      "rpeTitle": "RPE Workflow Architecture",
      "rpeDescription": "Like humans, artificial intelligences perform tasks better when they systematically engage with the task context before implementation. Humans don't jump directly into complex tasks, but first understand the task, research missing information and relevant references, then plan step-by-step actions before execution. The RPE (Research-Plan-Execute) framework mimics this systematic approach and greatly enhances agentic system capabilities. The diagram below illustrates this agentic workflow, showcasing both the RPE framework and its AI Agent Architecture working in harmony."

      "title": "AI Video Face Search",
      "description": "Computer vision system detecting specified people or objects for B-roll classification",
      "fullDescription": "An intelligent computer vision pipeline that automatically identifies and classifies specific people or objects in video content, streamlining B-roll footage organization and retrieval.",
      "overview": "Developed a specialized computer vision system that processes video content to automatically detect, classify, and catalog specific individuals or objects, dramatically improving media workflow efficiency for content creators.",
      "challenge1": "Achieving accurate person/object detection across varying lighting conditions and camera angles",
      "challenge2": "Building efficient processing pipelines for high-volume video content",

      "solution2": "Developed robust preprocessing and post-processing pipelines for consistent performance",
      "solution3": "Built modular classification components allowing easy customization for different use cases",
      "executiveSummary": "This application automates the labor-intensive process of video indexing. Originally designed for media production teams, it uses advanced computer vision to scan hours of footage and instantly locate specific individuals, transforming a manual search task into an automated, high-speed workflow.",
      "businessContext": "Content creators and media archives face a common challenge: retrieving specific footage from massive video libraries is slow and expensive. Manual review of B-roll or archival footage creates a bottleneck. This solution addresses this by enabling 'semantic' search within video content—finding people not by file name, but by their visual identity.",
      "technicalApproach": "The system utilizes a One-Shot Learning approach using Deep Learning (Inception Resnet V1). Unlike traditional models requiring thousands of training images, this architecture 'enrolls' a new identity from just a few reference photos. It combines MTCNN for robust face detection with Facenet-PyTorch for generating 512-dimensional embeddings, allowing for precise identity matching across varying lighting and angles.",
      "keyOutcomes": "Achieved real-time processing speeds for standard definition video. The system successfully handles partial occlusions and profile views. Provided a user-friendly Streamlit interface that abstracts complex ML operations, making the technology accessible to non-technical video editors.",
      "businessValue": "Drastically reduces post-production search time, allowing teams to repurpose existing content more effectively. The 'enrollment' feature offers flexibility to track new subjects without engineering intervention, ensuring the tool scales with the organization's needs.",
      "demoTitle": "Live Streamlit Demo",
      "demoDescription": "Try the application yourself. Upload a video and a reference photo (or use the demo data) to see the face search in action.",

      "githubDescription": "View the repository for technical details on the computer vision pipeline, embedding generation, and performance optimization.",
      "rpeTitle": "Computer Vision Pipeline",
      "rpeDescription": "The system follows a modular pipeline: Frame Extraction -> Face Detection (MTCNN) -> Embedding Generation (Inception Resnet) -> Vector Similarity Search. This modularity allows for independent optimization of each stage, balancing speed and accuracy."

The contact person is authorized to make declarations that are necessary as interim decisions in the context of continuing the order and provides the employees of Brian Zelun Jin with access to the information necessary for their activity at all times and supplies them with all required documents in a timely manner. The Customer has no right to give instructions to the employees of Brian Zelun Jin.",
        "section5_title": "§ 5 Confidentiality",

        "section6_title": "§ 6 Copyright",
        "section6_para1": "(1) Brian Zelun Jin grants the Customer a simple right of use and exploitation for all copyrights arising from the project contract at Brian Zelun Jin. The Customer does not owe separate compensation for this grant.",

        "section7_para1": "(1) If an action by the Customer is required for the performance of the service obligation incumbent upon Brian Zelun Jin, then Brian Zelun Jin may, if the Customer falls into default of acceptance by omitting the action, demand reasonable compensation including necessary additional expenses. For this purpose, Brian Zelun Jin calculates a flat-rate compensation of EUR 100.00 per calendar day, beginning with the execution deadline of the service contract - in the absence of an execution deadline - with the notification of readiness to perform. The proof of higher damage and the legal claims of Brian Zelun Jin (in particular compensation for additional expenses, reasonable compensation, termination) remain unaffected; the flat rate is to be offset against further monetary claims. The Customer remains permitted to prove that Brian Zelun Jin has incurred no damage at all or only substantially less damage than the above flat rate.",
        "section7_para2": "(2) If a case of para. 1 sentence 1 exists, Brian Zelun Jin is entitled to set a reasonable deadline for the Customer to make up for the action with the declaration that Brian Zelun Jin will terminate the project contract if the action is not undertaken by the expiration of the deadline.

        "section8_para1": "(1) Brian Zelun Jin is liable according to statutory provisions, subject to para. 2.",
        "section8_para2": "(2) For damages, Brian Zelun Jin is liable - regardless of the legal basis - according to statutory provisions if the breach of duty by Brian Zelun Jin - including their representatives and vicarious agents - results in injury to life, body or health (subject to statutory liability limitations (e.g. care in own affairs; insignificant breach of duty)). Brian Zelun Jin is also liable according to statutory provisions if the Customer's claim for damages is based on intent or gross negligence by Brian Zelun Jin - including their representatives and vicarious agents. Furthermore, Brian Zelun Jin is liable for simple negligence according to statutory provisions (subject to statutory liability limitations (e.g. care in own affairs; insignificant breach of duty)) if Brian Zelun Jin culpably violates an essential contractual obligation (obligation whose fulfillment first enables the proper performance of the contract and on whose compliance the contracting party regularly relies and may rely); in this case, however, liability for damages is limited to the contractually typical, foreseeable damage. Insofar as Brian Zelun Jin is not liable according to the preceding sentences, Brian Zelun Jin's liability due to defective performance is excluded. Insofar as Brian Zelun Jin's liability is limited according to the preceding sentences, the limitations apply correspondingly to the personal liability of Brian Zelun Jin's employees. § 639 BGB remains unaffected.",
        "section9_title": "§ 9 Force Majeure",
        "section9_content": "Events of force majeure that make performance substantially more difficult or temporarily impossible for Brian Zelun Jin entitle Brian Zelun Jin to postpone the fulfillment of their obligations by the duration of the impediment plus a reasonable start-up time.

        "section10_title": "§ 10 Contract Duration",
        "section10_content": "The project contract is completed when the services listed in the project contract have been properly rendered.",
        "section11_title": "§ 11 Fees, Ancillary Costs, Due Dates",
        "section11_content": "The fee for the services of Brian Zelun Jin is to be calculated according to the time spent on the activity, possibly including travel time (time-based fee).

Unless otherwise agreed in individual cases, the current Brian Zelun Jin list rates applicable at the time of contract conclusion apply, plus statutory value-added tax. Billing of services rendered is generally carried out monthly. All invoices are to be paid within 15 days of invoice creation including the indicated value-added tax, if applicable. Cash discount is only granted after express agreement. Unjustified cash discount deductions by the Customer will be reclaimed by Brian Zelun Jin.",
        "section12_title": "§ 12 Assignment",
        "section12_content": "An assignment of rights or transfer of obligations from project contracts requires the prior written consent of both contracting parties. § 354a HGB remains unaffected.",
        "section13_title": "§ 13 Reference Information",
        "section13_content": "Brian Zelun Jin is entitled to list the Customer including the type of services provided in an appropriate scope and taking into account any confidentiality interests of the Customer in a customer directory and to use this for reference and acquisition purposes.

        "section14_para2": "(2) Additions and deviations from these terms and conditions require written form. This also applies to the cancellation of the written form requirement. § 305b BGB remains unaffected.",
        "section14_para3": "(3) The legal invalidity of an agreement in this contract does not affect the legal validity of the other agreements in this contract. Should a provision be invalid or unenforceable or become so, the remaining provisions remain unaffected. The parties undertake in this case to negotiate an effective provision that comes closest to the invalid provision in economic result and best corresponds to the purpose arising from the present contract. This also applies in case of partial invalidity of individual provisions and other non-regulated matters, i.e. contractual gaps.",
        "section14_para4": "(4) The law of the Federal Republic of Germany applies. Exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising directly or indirectly from the contractual relationship is the registered office of Brian Zelun Jin in Munich. Priority statutory provisions, in particular regarding exclusive jurisdictions, remain unaffected.",
